    "### Exercise 3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that, for periodic motion, the abbreviated action $I$ will remain constant, even if system parameters are varied slowly.  In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the abbreviated action is given by $I=\\pi E/\\omega$, where $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$. Thus, according to this relation, the initial energy and final energy, after slowly changing a system parameter, will be related as $\\frac{E_0}{\\omega_0}=\\frac{E_1}{\\omega_1}$.  Using the techniques developed in this class, find the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator if the spring constant is slowly increased over time, where the final value is twice the initial.  How close are you to the analytical result?"

    "In Phys 7301, we considered motion of a particle in a central potential given by $$V=\\frac{k}{r}+\\frac{k'}{r^2}$$  Using Action-Angle variables, it was shown that for specific values of $k$ and $k'$, the orbit would be closed (i.e. n oscillations along r and m rotations in $\\theta$).  For simplicity, consider a particle of unit mass, where $k=1$.  Find 5 values of $k'$ for which the orbit is closed (i.e. the particle returns to the exact same point in phase space at a later time). Note: it can be very helpful to visualize the paths."
