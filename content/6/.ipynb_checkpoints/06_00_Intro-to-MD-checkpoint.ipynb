    "Molecular Dynamics\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have studied the dynamics behavior of systems with only a\n",
    "few particles. However, many systems in nature such as gases, liquids\n",
    "and solids contain many mutually interacting particles. A typical\n",
    "problem involves $%\n",
    "10^{23}-10^{25}$ molecules which, to a good approximation, obey the laws\n",
    "of classical physics. Although the intermolecular forces produce a\n",
    "complicated trajectory for each particle, the observable properties of\n",
    "the whole are averages that do not depend on the individual behavior.\n",
    "The motion is completely determined by the classical equations of\n",
    "motion, and all the physics is contained in the intramolecular\n",
    "potential, *i.e.* the interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem consists in understanding the properties of the whole,\n",
    "starting from the known interactions. The most direct approach is to\n",
    "simulate the problem with a computer. The problem of simulating a system\n",
    "with $%\n",
    "10^{23}-10^{25}$ particles requires the power of a supercomputer, and\n",
    "using parallelization techniques. However we can learn the principles\n",
    "using a fraction of that number, say $10^{4}$ particles, that is\n",
    "tractable in a PC. Not only we can learn about about many of the instead\n",
    "of statistical mechanics, but also the basic simulation techniques. The\n",
    "technique that we will learn in this section does not differ in essence\n",
    "from that used in supercomputers, and it is called “molecular dynamics”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intermolecular potential\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first goal is to identify the model we want to simulate. The first\n",
    "simplification is to consider the molecules spherical, chemically inert,\n",
    "and that they move according to the laws of classical mechanics. We also\n",
    "assume that the force between molecules depends only on the distance\n",
    "between them. The form of this potential for electrically neutral atoms\n",
    "can be constructed from a detailed first principles quantum mechanical\n",
    "calculation. Such calculation can be complicated, so we will consider a\n",
    "phenomenological form. The most important features are: **strong\n",
    "repulsion at short distances, weak attraction at large separations**.\n",
    "The repulsion originates from the electrostatic interaction between\n",
    "equally charged particles, and the long range attraction from the mutual\n",
    "polarization of the electronic clouds, known as “van de Waals” force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we list some model potentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "& \\mathrm{Hard\\,\\, Spheres} & V(r)=\\infty    \\mathrm{\\,\\,if\\,\\,} r<r_{o} & \\mathrm{First\\,\\, approximation} \\\\    \n",

    "Tricks of the trade\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Meters and kilograms are not meant to measure molecules. Using these\n",
    "units would imply the clumsy manipulation of small numbers. We want to\n",
    "choose units of mass, energy, and length such that the values of the\n",
    "quantities are always of the order $1$. For instance, in the case of the\n",
    "Lennard-Jones potential is wise to use $\\sigma $ as a unit of length,\n",
    "$\\epsilon $ as a unit of energy, and $m_{0}=1AMU$ as the unit of mass.\n",
    "Re-scaling by these quantities, the potential would be\n",
    "$$V^{*}(r)=4\\left[ u^{-12}-u^{-6}\\right] ,$$ where $V^{*}=V/\\epsilon $\n",
    "and $u=r/\\sigma $. The advantages are that the Lennard-Jones parameters\n",
    "never show in the formulas, and that we are spared of many\n",
    "computationally expensive calculations. With this choice of units, we\n",
    "find that time is measured in units of $t_{0}=\\sqrt{m_{0}\\sigma\n",
    "^{2}/\\epsilon }$. For the electrical charge, the natural unit is the\n",
    "charge of the electron $e$, and for temperature, $\\epsilon /k$. After\n",
    "finishing the simulation, we transform the results back to the original\n",
    "units to be compared with the experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "#### Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure out how to rescale the units for argon atoms interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential.\n",
    "The parameters for Ar are $\\epsilon = 0.0104 eV$, $\\sigma = 3.40$ ${\\buildrel _{\\circ} \\over {\\mathrm{A}}}$. The mass of one argon atom is $m = 39.948 AMU$.\n",
    "!-->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "**Hint:** The program should use eVs as the unit of energy and temperature (so Boltzmann’s constant is $k_B = 1$), and ${\\buildrel _{\\circ} \\over {\\mathrm{A}}}$ for the unit of distance. Time is measured in femtoseconds.\n",
    "Since the energy is in eV as a function of ${\\buildrel_{\\circ} \\over {\\mathrm{A}}}$, the force will be in units of $eV/{\\buildrel_{\\circ} \\over {\\mathrm{A}}}$. \n",
    "!-->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "![pbc](pbc.png)\n",
    "#### Example of periodic boundary conditions in 2D. Note that particle 1 is about to leave the left face of the central cell and to enter the center cell trhough the right face. The minimum image distance convention inplies that the separation between particles 1 and 2 is given by the bold line\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "Since the size of our system is typically 10-100 molecular diameters,\n",
    "this is certainly not a good representation for a macroscopic sample\n",
    "because most of the particles will be situated near a “wall” or\n",
    "“boundary”.!-->\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the effects of the boundaries and to simulate\n",
    "more closely the properties of the macroscopic system, it is convenient\n",
    "to choose “periodic boundary conditions”. This means that our basic box\n",
    "containing $N$ particles is surrounded by images (or replicas) of\n",
    "itself. This is equivalent to wrap the coordinates around the\n",
    "boundaries: when one particles hits a wall, instead of bouncing pack, it\n",
    "reappears on the other side of the box. This means that the system has\n",
    "the topology of a torus. If the linear size of the box is $L$, the\n",
    "maximum separation between particles is $L/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this way the number of\n",
    "particles in a given box is always conserved. A particle crossing the\n",
    "right boundary is automatically replaced by a particle entering the\n",
    "left, and vice versa (Adding $2L$ before the modulo operation is to\n",
    "catch any runaway particles with $x_{i}<-L$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the potential energy or the force between two particles $i$\n",
    "and $j\n",
    "$ one augments the periodic boundary conditions we have to adopt the\n",
    "so-called “nearest image convention”. Imagine that the two particles on\n",
    "opposite sides of the box. The convention dictates that we have to adopt\n",
    "the minimum distance across the walls, or between images in the\n",
    "neighboring replicas. If $\\Delta x_{ij}=x_{j}-x_{i}$ is larger than\n",
    "$L/2$, then the particle $j$ will be disregarded as an interaction\n",
    "partner of $i$, with its left image, having coordinate $x_{j}-L$ in its\n",
    "place. In practice this means simply that when calculating $V(r_{ij})$\n",
    "we have to use the quantity $\\Delta\n",
    "x_{ij}-L$ instead of $\\Delta x_{ij}$. An analogous rule holds for\n",
    "$\\Delta\n",
    "x_{ij}\\leq -L/2$ and for the other coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule can be expressed by\n",
    "$$\\Delta x=\\Delta x-L\\mathrm{int}\\left( \\frac{\\Delta x}{L}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules  can be replaced by \"if\"\n",
    "expressions. In a parallel code this is counter productive, but in a\n",
    "serial code may be preferable. The optimal choice should be based on\n",
    "benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "![initial](initial.png)\n",
    "#### Initial configuration with particles in vertices of a a) triangular; b) rectangular lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking the right starting configuration is\n",
    "not trivial. The first choice would be to place the molecules randomly\n",
    "distributed, but this would give rise to large starting energies and\n",
    "forces, since many pairs would be placed at unphysical short distances.\n",
    "It is therefore customary to place the particles in the vertices of a\n",
    "some crystal lattice (face centered cubic –or triangular–, for\n",
    "instance). The $x$ and $y$ components of the velocities can be picked\n",
    "randomly in an interval $[-v_{\\max },v_{\\max }]$. Before starting the\n",
    "proper simulation and the measurement of the physical quantities, it is\n",
    "necessary to perform a “thermalization” run to let the system relax to a\n",
    "situation of dynamical and thermal equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possibilities consist of arranging the particles in a regular periodic structure as shown in the figure. The velocities are again picked randomly, and the system must evolve for some time to thermalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusting density and temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of particles is usually fixed and conserved, the way to\n",
    "achieve the desired density is to adjust the volume. This is done\n",
    "scaling all coordinates by a suitable factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Molecular Dynamics, the temperature is a measurable quantity. Kinetic\n",
    "theory tells us that $$T=m\\langle |\\mathbf{v}|^{2}\\rangle /3k,$$ where\n",
    "$k$ is the Boltzmann’s constant, and $\\langle |\\mathbf{v}|^{2}\\rangle $\n",
    "is the averaged square of the velocity. In a simulation, we have to\n",
    "average this quantity over a number of MD steps to get a measurement of\n",
    "$T$. If we want to simulate a particular temperature, we rescale each\n",
    "component of the velocity vector of every particle by\n",
    "$\\sqrt{T_{desired}/T_{actual}}$. Obviously $T$ is a fluctuating quantity\n",
    "and can therefore be adjusted only approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MD simulation: Continuous (Analytic) potentials\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between hard particles was considered as an\n",
    "instantaneous collision process, with forces of infinite strength acting\n",
    "instantaneously during infinitely short times. A dynamical equation is\n",
    "of no use in such model, and it was therefore appropriate to calculate\n",
    "the collision laws to obtain the new velocities. In between collisions,\n",
    "the particles fly freely without acceleration. In contrast, for a\n",
    "continuous varying potential, the particles are either in a force field,\n",
    "or interact with some other particle at long distances and at any time.\n",
