    "Here, we will build upon earlier concepts of covariance to understand how one may decompose the dynamics of a many-variable system. Previously, we considered the second moment of an arbitrary quantity $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle A^2(\\vec x, \\vec p)\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This average is taken over every particle/state of the system, where $A^2$ is evaluated at each time point. A common example would be the mean squared fluctuations of a particle. In that case, $A$ would simply be $x-\\langle x\\rangle$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also extended this  idea to consider the covariance of quantities.  For example, we will consider quantities $A$ and $B$, both of which are functions of the coordinates/momenta.  The covariance would then be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle A B\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, technically this is only the mean of the product of the A and B.  The covariance would be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle (A-\\langle A\\rangle) (B-\\langle B\\rangle)\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two quantities are uncorrelated, then the covariance would be equal to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, rather than consider covariance of only two different quantities, let's extend this to a general description of an arbitrary number of variables  $q_i$.\n",
    "Now, we can define the covariance of any two terms as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov_{ij}=\\langle (q_i-\\langle q_i\\rangle) (q_j-\\langle q_j\\rangle)\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify this a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov_{ij}=\\langle (q_i-\\langle q_i\\rangle)q_j-(q_i-\\langle q_i\\rangle)\\langle q_j\\rangle)\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov_{ij}=\\langle (q_iq_j-\\langle q_i\\rangle q_j)-(q_i\\langle q_j\\rangle-\\langle q_i\\rangle\\langle q_j\\rangle)\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov_{ij}=\\langle q_iq_j \\rangle -\\langle q_i\\rangle \\langle q_j\\rangle -\\langle q_i\\rangle\\langle q_j\\rangle+\\langle q_i\\rangle\\langle q_j\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov_{ij}=\\langle q_iq_j \\rangle -\\langle q_i\\rangle \\langle q_j\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have the values of $cov_{ij}$ can define a symmetric matrix of real values. We can define this as matrix $M$.  In general, this will be a large matrix with many off-diagonal elements, making it very difficult to interpret.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we define the vector $\\delta q=q-\\langle q\\rangle$, then we can express $M$ as: $$M=\\langle \\delta q \\delta q^T\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still a diagonal matrix, which we diagonalize via a similarity transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Lambda = N^{-1} M N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where N is an orthogonal matrix composed of the eigenvectors of M.  $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix.  So, why is this interesting? Let's apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M=\\langle \\delta q \\delta q^T\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N^{-1}MN=N^{-1}\\langle \\delta q \\delta q^T \\rangle N $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N=\\langle N^{-1} \\delta q \\delta q^T N \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's define a new set of coordinates as ($Q$ is a vector):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q= N^{-1} \\delta q $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $Q^T=\\delta q^T N$, such that $$\\Lambda = \\langle N^{-1}MN \\rangle = \\langle Q^T Q \\rangle$$, which is diagonal, and the eigenvalue describes the mean squared values of each new coordinate! These new coordinates are called Principal Components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the linear transformation $Q= N^{-1} \\delta q $ defines new set of coordinates, along which the dynamics is linearly uncorrelated.  Thus, if we calculate the covariance matrix and diagonalize it, we will have be able to define a set of coordinates along which the dynamics may be decomposed into linearly-uncorrelated motions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see this in action.\n",

    "Building upon earlier efforts, write the code to simulate an N particle system, where particles $i$ and $i+1$ interact through Hookean springs of natural length zero. Particle 1 and N also interact with immovable boundaries. Orient your particles and boundaries along the x axis.  Initialize the system with random y velocities, only.  Simulate the system and calculate the covariance matrix for the y components. Diagonalize the matrix to find the principal components. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, give each particle unit mass, space the particles 1 unit length apart and set the spring constant to 1.  Perform your simulation for a system with 100 particles. Perform your simulation for $10^6$ timesteps of size 0.02.  To visualize your PCs, plot the amplitude of the elements of each mode as a function of particle number. Plot the first 5 modes (i.e. largest eigenvalues). Do the look familiar?\n",
